#### Challenge:<br/>
The last year has resulted in a new way of working, socialising, learning and living. We would like to challenge participants to come up with innovative ways of improving lives in this lockdown era.<br/>

We are leaving the challenge as open ended as possible, the sole goal is to build something that you feel brings a positive impact to people working, schooling and socialising at home. Some examples of areas we feel could benefit from innovative thinking are:<br/>

• Working and collaborating: could you building something that makes it easier for teams to work together? Perhaps think about sharing information, collaborating on design, plugins for messaging apps etc<br/>

• Home Schooling and Learning: what innovative solutions could you look at to help parents home school, helps children learn or helps balance the time between working during the day whilst looking after children.<br/>

• Mental Health: many people have suffered from being in extended periods of lockdown. Are there solutions that could help people who have felt isolated?<br/>

• Socialising: families and friends have been coming together to regularly play quizzes or online games together. What could you build that helps bring families and friends together<br/>

• Entertainment and Health: being stuck in the house has led to people looking for new ways to entertain their children. What innovative ideas and designs could you come up with to help. Can we use technology to come up with ways to help parents entertain their children by blending tech and physical activities<br/>

• Any other ideas: as mentioned we would like this to be as open as possible. If there are other areas/businesses that you believe could benefit from a software solution then feel free to build something of your own selection.
